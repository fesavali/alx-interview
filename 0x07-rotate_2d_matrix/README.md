o solve the question without any extra space, rotate the array in form of squares, dividing the matrix into squares or cycles. For example, 
A 4 X 4 matrix will have 2 cycles. The first cycle is formed by its 1st row, last column, last row, and 1st column. The second cycle is formed by the 2nd row, second-last column, second-last row, and 2nd column. The idea is for each square cycle, to swap the elements involved with the corresponding cell in the matrix in an anti-clockwise direction i.e. from top to left, left to bottom, bottom to right, and from right to top one at a time using nothing but a temporary variable to achieve this
